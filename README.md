# BT-ComplexInitiative


## Development

## Design

There are 5 vanilla initiative phases, 5->1
- Your place in init order is determined by mech tonnage group (4=light, 3=medium, 2=heavy, 1=assault)
- Your init is reduced by knockdowns, some abilities (RT juggernaut, etc)
- Your init is increased by abilities (??)

New model

TODO:
* Melee attacks reduce your initiative by the difference in tonnage; a 100t vs. 100t has limited impact, a 100t vs. 20t a bigger impact. Piloting skill mitigates this.
* Test interactions with init modifying abilities; Juggernaught, Offensive Push, etc
